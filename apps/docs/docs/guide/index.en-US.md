# What is this?

In the development process of [**Ant Design Style**](https://github.com/ant-design/antd-style), in order to test and validate the capabilities of custom themes, dynamic theme algorithms, etc., many stylized styles were tried on the basis of antd basic components, such as gradients, frosted glass blurs, etc. As many people expressed their love for this design, it was extracted into a separate [**dumi2**](https://github.com/umijs/dumi) theme package for reuse.
